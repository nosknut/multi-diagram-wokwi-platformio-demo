# Project Structure

- `/wokwi-sims` contains a folder for each simulation.
- The `wokwi.toml` files contain a **relative** path to the firmware files generated by platformio when the code is compiled.
    - Note that the firmware path for each simulation is different for each PlatformIO environment.
        - [uno_one_led](wokwi-sims/one-led/wokwi.toml)
        - [uno_two_leds](wokwi-sims/two-leds/wokwi.toml)
- The code is in `/src/main.cpp`, and has a preprocessor directive `TWO_LEDS` that can be defined in `/platformio.ino` to include the code for `LED_2`.
- When `env:uno_one_led` is selected, the `TWO_LEDS` directive is not defined, all code depending on it will be excluded from compilation (the code should be grayed out).
- When `env:uno_two_leds` is selected, the `TWO_LEDS` directive is defined, all code depending on it will be included in compilation (the code should not be grayed out).
- The env can be selected at the bottom of the screen when the PlatformIO extension is active.
